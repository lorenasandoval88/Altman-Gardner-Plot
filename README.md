# Altman-Gardner-Plot
Gardner-Altman plot for two-sample effect size, showing a difference in mean between two groups.


Gardner & Altman (1986) introduced plots for simultaneously showing confidence intervals and data, arguing that confidence intervals should be used to show the main result of studies, rather than p-values,

Gardner-Altman plot displays the two sample data on the left. The median of the sample 0 corresponds to the zero effect size on the right axis. The median of the sample 1 corresponds to the value of the effect size on right axis. The plot displays the actual median difference effect size value and the confidence intervals with the vertical error bar.
