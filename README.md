# Altman-Gardner-Plot
Gardner-Altman plot for two-sample effect size, showing a difference in mean between two groups.


Gardner & Altman (1986) introduced plots for simultaneously showing confidence intervals and data, arguing that confidence intervals should be used to show the main result of studies, rather than p-values,

The plot (below) displays the two sample data on the left. The mean of "Control1" corresponds to the zero effect size on the right axis. The mean of the "Group1" corresponds to the value of the effect size on right axis. The plot displays the actual median difference effect size value and the confidence intervals with the vertical error bar.
